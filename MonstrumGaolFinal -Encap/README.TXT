USER INSTRUCTIONS:

To play this game the user will roll a die and decide which of their pieces they will want to move, movement is based on die roll value, if the player rolls a 2 they will be able to move two space forward. Spaces with Alchemic symbols are safe spaces where players can not be attacked and where they are able to roll a second time. After the player rolls and moves their selected piece the computer will do the same. If a team lands their piece on another teams piece they will take over that space and send the opposing teams piece back to the beginning. when this happens a tabletop will appear where players can play, rock, paper scissors for bonus points. the rock, paper, scissors game ends when a team reaches 2 points. A team will get bonus points from each hand they hold a point and then another if they win. To win the game a player must either get all of their pieces to their goal zone or get enough bonus points to win.
